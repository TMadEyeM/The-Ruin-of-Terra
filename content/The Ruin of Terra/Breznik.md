The first night of sleep after the visit from this new wraith, Sinemi Drianish noticed the blood red coin begin to float and vibrate from inside her bag. waking the group to discuss it was decided that the coin should stay where it is.

Beginning the journey to Breznik the party bought a single horse and cart to ease their journey. On their travels many conversations were had between members mainly around their backgrounds and their planned goals in life. Halfway to their destination they decided to stop and attempt to bury the blood red coin, attempting to let the coin go. Sinemi Drianish felt a powerful urge to hold on to the coin and keep it in her person.

Arriving in Breznik Fjord Faircreek attempted to bring life back into the dying crops but to no avail. Arriving in the town the group went straight to local inn The White Rose meeting the town Major and Inn keep Moira. Asking questions around what has happened recently the only oddity was 2 merchants came to town, 1 has since left but the other remains Lorenzo. The group decided to wait for Lorenzo, while chatting to other patrons they learn of a child who has gone missing.

The party found the child and went over to help but the local villagers were already there. Further down the track heading towards the coast they came across a weird creature who only showed their eyes from below the ground. Through gasping breaths they communicated and learnt that this creature was the cause of the drought and that it seeks revenge from within the village.

After trying to locate Lorenzo who had gone to gather herbs for *pigments*. The party decided to break into her rooms. Finding herbs used for poisons hanging to dry and another room filled with vials filled with badly brewed poison and in her main bedroom a journal uncovering all of their past and current heists.

After attempting to go to the drop zone to locate Lorenzo or the buyer, they returned to town and started making their way back to the coast. Nearly there they heard screams coming from the town rushing back they found Moira dead with her throat slit, going upstairs the rooms they found 2 more bodies.

Rushing to the coast following the trail of blood the group located both Lorenzo and the creature now known to Sariel. After a short confrontation the group dealt with both Sariel and Lorenzo ending the drought that plagued this town. Attempting to dig up the stolen artwork Taliyah Tolrock dugÂ  a little too deep and ruined this prized piece of art.
