The group received work to escort Gudrum and a cart filled with precious ores to the town of Phandalin. Along their journey the group lost Gudrum as he attempted to clear an obstacle in the road. Following his tracks the group located Gudrum who had been captured by a goblin pack.

Clearing the cave that the goblins called their home and saving Gudrum. They continued on their journey where a mysterious black smoke engulfed Gudrum causing him to *once again be kidnapped.* Making their way back to the town of Phandalin the group found themselves in a cosy tavern owned by Taber Terwey. After not so much persuasion he has agreed to branch his business out to other towns and re-brand to ***The Weathered Spoon***. 

 Speaking with a few of the locals, Juliane Fricker the local healer and priestess gave the group a job to clear a strange aberration that has been seen near a local chapel. The Major who informed the group of the local bandits calling themselves Redbrands and that his advisor has recently gone missing.

Following this information the group started to investigate the Redbrands and learnt that a small child and her mother had recently been kidnapped after their husband spoke out against them. Following their track they found an underground cave system which through careful *planning* the group cleared saving the child and mother and learning that the majors advisor was helping the Redbrands.

Pushing the Redbrands out of the town, the group started asking more questions of the locals finding an old Elven Adventurer Iston Black who informed them that the Redbrands had also setup in Cragmore Castle. With a swift punch from Grelilah Relotoff he agreed that if the group cleared the castle he would assist them further.

Going to Cragmore Castle the group cleared it with only a couple close calls, Fjord Faircreek being killed by an Owlbear only to be brought straight back. Finding Gudrum with a larger than average Bugbear and a Drow holding him at knife point. With quick words and cunning actions Gudrum was freed and informed the group of the Drows plans to use Wave Echo Cave and the forge found there to make world ending weapons.
