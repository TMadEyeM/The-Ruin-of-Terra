The group received work to escort Gudrum and a cart filled with precious ores to the town of Phandalin. Along their journey the group lost Gudrum as he attempted to clear an obstacle in the road. Following his tracks the group located Gudrum who had been captured by a goblin pack.

Clearing the cave that the goblins called their home and saving Gudrum. They continued on their journey where a mysterious black smoke engulfed Gudrum causing him to *once again be kidnapped.* Making their way back to the town of Phandalin the group found themselves in a cozy tavern owned by Taber Terwey. After not so much persuasion he has agreed to branch his business out to other towns and rebrand to ***The Weathered Spoon***. 

Speaking with a few of the locals, Juliane Fricker the local healer and priestess gave the group a job to clear a strange aberration that has been seen near a local chapel. The Major who informed the group of the local bandits calling themselves Redbrands and that his advisor has recently gone missing.

Following this information the group started to investigate the Redbrands and learnt that a small child and her mother had recently been kidnapped after their husband spoke out against them. Following their track they found an underground cave system which through careful *planning* the group cleared, saving the child and mother and learning that the majors advisor was helping the Redbrands.

Pushing the Redbrands out of the town, the group started asking more questions of the locals, finding an old Elven Adventurer Iston Black who informed them that the Redbrands had also set up in Cragmore Castle. With a swift punch from Grelilah Relotoff he agreed that if the group cleared the castle he would assist them further.

On route to Cragmore Castle the group found a small rotted and destroyed village. No time was put into searching it thoroughly but they did encounter a Small Green Dragon (Franklin) who they gave a single gold piece to.

Going to Cragmore Castle the group cleared it with only a couple close calls, Fjord Faircreek being killed by an Owlbear only to be brought straight back. Finding Gudrum with a larger than average Bugbear and a Drow holding him at knife point. With quick words and cunning actions Gudrum was freed and informed the group of the Drows plans through a group called the Black Spider to use Wave Echo Cave and the forge found there to make world ending weapons.

Going to Wave Echo Cave with Gudrum they found the deceased body of his younger brother disturbingly Taliyah Tolrock decided to check the body but in doing so she crushed the ribcage and decimated the corpse. The group then carefully moved and cleared room by room although getting oddly fixated on a single room with a drill where they encountered Ru-Paul the Flaming skull. Dealing with Ru-Paul and investigating other areas they eventually found 2 small buildings inside this cave system inside 1 there was just a single Spector and the other there was Mormesk the wraith who tasked the players with clearing and finding the forge.

After working their way to the end of the cave system the group encountered several giant spiders as well as the *leader of the Black Spiders* after getting cooked nice and toasty inside a small room they finished the Drow. Looking around the room Sinemi Drianish spotted 2 giant emeralds in the eye's of a statue to Sindra the Goddess of the Forge. Removing these gems the ceiling collapsed nearly killing a couple party members. 

While 3 members helped Gudrum to clear the rubble and dig to the forge. Sinemi Drianish
and Fjord Faircreek went back to town to build morale, speaking with the Major they organized a strip tease in the local Weathered Spoon. This worked and as thanks for their work a statue of the group is now under construction. 

After making their way down to the forge Mormesk showed his face again but this time much more hostile, easily defeating him, as his form dissipated a blood red gold coin dropped instantly being snatched up by Sinemi Drianish. The forge was now secure and as part of the deal Gudrum forged the group each a unique item.

Spending some time in the town and winding down after the chaos that has been the group's last month or so while drinking in the tavern. Time froze around them and another aberration much larger and more intimidating than Mormesk floated in. He advised the party to stop interfering and let them off due to not knowing. The party tried asking to help him in his plans for a peaceful world but to test their loyalty he tasked them with Purging the town then left.

Deciding not to kill everyone they just spent time trying to save they decided to move on, South to Breznik to deal with a strange drought.
