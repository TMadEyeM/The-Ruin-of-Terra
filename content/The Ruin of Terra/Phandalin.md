The group received work to escort Gudrum and a cart filled with precious ores to the town of Phandalin. Along their journey the group lost Gudrum as he attempted to clear an obstacle in the road. Following his tracks the group located Gudrum who had been captured by a goblin pack.

Clearing the cave that the goblins called their home they continued on their journey where a mysterious black smoke engulfed Gudrum causing him to *once again be kidnapped.* Making their way back to the town of Phandalin the group found themselves in a cosy tavern owned by Taber Terwey. After not so much persuasion he has agreed to branch his business out to other towns and re-brand to ***The Weathered Spoon***.
