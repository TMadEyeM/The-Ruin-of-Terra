**Session Notes**
---

Upon waking up not so fully rested, the party set their sights on the library. Upon entering the group was met by an old lady who introduced herself as Ruth the owner of this Library.

With only limited book found on wraiths the party pressed for more information where Ruth  disclosed a sealed chamber below the library. Hesitant at first she eventually agreed to the party entering and investigating. 

Receiving a glass like stone from Ruth and placing it on a pedestal the first door opened up where the group encountered 3 Nothics similar to the ones found in the  cave at Phandalin. Effortlessly dealing with them, the carpets under their feet came to life and started to engulf the party. With a few injuries the carpets where dealt with and the party moved on to the next 2 doors. To the right with the Glass Stone found in this room the door was unlocked but once opened the party where hit with 2 consecutive Fireballs with nothing else in this room other than a  3rd Glass Stone they turned to the 2nd door. This door only had a knocker which came to life and spoke "who's there" after a few failed attempts Grelilah hit the door with aged old knock knock joke which burst the knocker into fits of laughter unlocking the door and giving access to the 4th Glass Stone.

With all the stones found the main door unlocked revealing a very well kept library upon walking further in as figure appeared at the desk at the back of the room. Initially greeting you as master but soon realising you are not his master. From a small conversation you learn he is here of his own free will writing the history of the Wraiths work.

A fight ensures long and gruelling several members of the party nearly losing their lives. Several books flying around casting spells to either hinder the party or cure the Figure but eventually he falls.
