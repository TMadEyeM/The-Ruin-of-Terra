The party returned to Phandalin, looking for work they learnt of a roaming orc horde to the north and a after to speaking with Iston they learnt of a yearly pub crawl called the Drunkards Dash in Neverwinter, where there is also a library that may contain information on the Wraith/Coin.

Doing what the party does best they went to Neverwinter to compete. After arriving and getting settled in the  first of many pubs they began, going strong with only a minor bit of cheating from Fjord. the made it most of the way through, Sinemi was the first to drop unconscious unable to continue followed by Grelilah. Nearing the end Fjord almost getting disqualified for becoming physically aggressive but managing to talk himself back into the game. Mortimer was the next to drop leaving Fjord to claim his prize the Mug of Merriment.

During their nights sleep to recover Grelilah was visited by the Goddess Luna, Luna voiced her disappointment at Grelilah for breaking her tenants.
